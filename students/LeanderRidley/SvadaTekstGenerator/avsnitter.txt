The chair has been used since antiquity, although for many centuries it was a symbolic article of state and dignity rather than an article for ordinary use. 
The chair is still used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings. 
In keeping with this historical connotation of the "chair" as the symbol of authority, committees, boards of directors, 
and academic departments all have a 'chairman' or 'chair'.
